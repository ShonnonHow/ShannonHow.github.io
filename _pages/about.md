I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in [Applied Mathematics and Computational Science](https://amcs.upenn.edu/) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in computational science at [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in June, 2024. My research interests include machine learning, scientific computing and sampling.
